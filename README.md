## üõ†Ô∏è Setup on QNAP NAS

(Hint: This app is based on the "File Station HTTP API v5" as documented here: https://eu1.qnap.com/dev/QNAP_QTS_File_Station_API_v5.pdf)
To host and run the app on your QNAP NAS:

### 1. Create `environment.ts`

- Copy `src/environments/environments.example.ts`and save as `src/environments/environment.ts`
- Change the value for apiUrl to the Url of the internal adress of your NAS device and the correct port

e.g.
```ts
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'http://123.456.789.10:9000',
};
```

Important: Do not commit this file to version control. Use .gitignore to exclude it.

### 2. Create `nas-config.ts`
- Copy `src/environments/nas-config.example.ts`and save as `src/environments/nas-config.ts`
- Change the values for nasFolderPath, nasUserName, nasPassword, to the shared Folder you want your pictures be uploaded to and a user's name and password that has full permissions on this folder

e.g.
```ts
export const nasConfig = {
    nasFolderPath: '/InventoryPictures',
    nasUserName: 'admin',
    nasPassword: 'Password'
};
```

Important: Do not commit this file to version control. Use .gitignore to exclude it.

### 3. Deploying the App to your QNAP WebServer

#### Activate the web server

Activate your web server in the control panel of QTS

#### üåç Build and  to QNAP NAS Web Server


- build the app with 
```bash
ng build --configuration=production
```
    the output will be located in 
    ```
    dist/box-app/browser/
    ```

- upload the files from the output folder of your project to the /Web shared folder of your NAS device
```
Web/boxApp/
```

- access it from your browser
```
http://<your-nas-ip>/boxApp/
```

Hint: Depending on your Qnap Settings you might also have to change the configuration of the Webserver to disable CORS protection (see also: https://www.qnap.com/en/how-to/faq/article/how-do-i-fix-cors-errors-when-accessing-qvr-apis-from-another-server)
